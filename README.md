# File Hosting Service
**Follow the below steps to begin collaborating on our project (Assuming you're on Windows 11):**

1. Choose a folder on your computer to place your project in, right click inside it and click "Open in Terminal".
   
2. Clone the repository and navigate into the newly created project folder using the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LCF2348/File_Hosting_Service.git
   cd File_Hosting_Service
**For the rest of these steps, continue executing them in your terminal (after you've navigated inside of your project folder).**

3. Create a Virtual Environment to manage project dependencies:
   ```bash
   py -3 -m venv .venv
4. Activate the environment:
   ```
   .venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install Flask using pip:
   ```
   pip install Flask
Note that steps 3-5 are needed because our repository doesn't hold our virtual environment or Flask installation.
